**Figure 2. GC viability in different stomatal opening buffer and leaf starch amounts under short day and neutral day.**

**Percentage of intact guard cells (GC) for GC-enriched epidermal fragments from Arabidopsis grown** under **neutral day (ND; 12 h light / 12 h dark; a, b)** or **short day (SD; 8 h light / 16 h dark; c, d)** conditions. For **mock treatment**, fragments were isolated, incubated for 30 min in **MES-BTP** (a, c) or **NaOH** buffer (b, d) in the dark, after which the blue light (BL) experiment was conducted. For mannitol treatment, fragments were stored in 0.5 M mannitol for 30 min in the dark, washed with 1 L of water, and transferred to the indicated buffer before BL exposure for 1 hour. Samples for the live/dead staining were collected after BL exposure and stained immediately. Representative images show **intact guard cells in green** and **non-intact guard cells in red**. Data represent *n* independent stomata per condition. Significant differences between mock and mannitol treatments were assessed using a **Wilcoxon test (\*, *p* < 0.05; \*\*, *p* < 0.01; \*\*\*, *p* < 0.001; ns, not significant)**. In e), an enzymatic assay was used to quantify the starch from whole leaves in ND- and SD-grown plants, for which a Wilcoxon test assessed significant differences in leaf starch content.
