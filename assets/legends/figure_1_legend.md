**Figure 1. GC starch dynamics and stomatal aperture in response to blue light in Arabidopsis plants grown under short day or neutral day.** GC starch dynamics **(a, b, e, f, i, j, m, n)** and stomatal aperture **(c, d, g, h, k, l, o, p)** were determined under neutral day (ND; 12 h light / 12 h dark; **a-h**) or short day (SD; 8 h light / 16 h dark; **i-p**) conditions. For mock treatments **(a, c, e, g, i, k, m, o)**, GC-enriched epidermal fragments were isolated and incubated for 30 min in either MES-BTP **(a-d, i-l)** or NaOH stomatal opening buffer **(e-h, m-p)** in the dark. At the end of the night (EoN), respective samples were collected and fragments were exposed to 1 hour of blue light (1h BL). For mannitol treatments **(b, d, f, h, j, l, n, p)**, fragments were stored in the dark in 0.5 M mannitol for 30 min after blending, after which samples were washed with 1 L of water and transferred to the indicated buffer before BL exposure. Data represent *n* independent stomata per time point and condition. Representative stomata per time point and condition are presented; scale bar = 10 um. Significant differences between EoN and 1h BL were assessed based on a Wilcoxon test (\*, *p* < 0.05; \*\*, *p* < 0.01; \*\*\*, *p* < 0.001; ns, not significant).
